                This thesis consists of three parts, each part addressing a challenging question as regards mathematical 
                and computational modeling in electrochemistry, with particular applications to Lithium-ion batteries. The 
                first problem concerns the mean-clustering approach to modeling the evolution of lattice dynamics, which 
                finds application in describing the lattice structure of Lithium-ion cathodes. Instead of tracking the state 
                of individual lattice sites, this approach describes the time evolution of the concentrations of different 
                cluster types. It leads to an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations which must be closed by 
                truncation using a so-called closure condition. The pair approximation is the most common form of such closure. 
                Here, we consider its generalization, termed the “optimal approximation”, which we calibrate using a robust data-driven 
                strategy. The form of the obtained optimal approximation allows us to deduce a simple sparse closure model. In 
                addition to being more accurate than the classical pair approximation, this “sparse approximation” is also physically 
                interpretable, which allows us to a posteriori refine the hypotheses underlying construction of this class of closure 
                models. On the other hand, parametrization of the mean-cluster model closed with the pair approximation is shown to 
                lead to an ill-posed inverse problem. In the second problem we investigate the question of the state-of-charge estimation 
                in cells operating under dynamic loading conditions. We use a hybrid data-driven strategy, referred to as “sparse 
                identification of nonlinear dynamics”, in order to obtain a sparse representation of the dynamics of the system based 
                on a provided library of candidates terms in the evolution equation. This strategy leverages the measurement data acquired 
                using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and the sparse regression techniques. The dynamical system identified in this 
                way is then used in combination with a suitable Kalman-type filter in order to enhance the estimates of the state of the 
                system based on the measurement data while in operation. In the third problem we construct a data-driven model describing 
                Lithium plating in a battery cell, which is a key process contributing to degradation of such cells. Starting from the 
                fundamental Doyle- Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, we use asymptotic reduction and spatial averaging techniques to derive a 
                simplified representation to track the temporal evolution of two key concentrations in the system, namely, the total 
                intercalated Lithium on the negative electrode particles and total plated Lithium. This model depends on an a priori 
                unknown constitutive relation representing the plating dynamics of the cell in function of the state variables. An 
                optimal form of this constitutive relation is then deduced from experimental measurements of the time-dependent 
                concentrations of different Lithium phases acquired through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. This is done 
                by solving an inverse problem in which this constitutive relation is found subject to minimum assumptions as a minimizer 
                of a suitable constrained optimization problem where the discrepancy between the model predictions and experimental data 
                is minimized. This optimization problem is solved using a state-of-the-art adjoint-based technique. In contrast to some 
                of the earlier approaches to modeling Lithium plating, the proposed model is also able to predict non-trivial evolution 
                of the concentrations in the relaxation regime when no current is applied to the cell. When equipped with an optimal 
                constitutive relation, the model provides accurate predictions of the time evolution of both intercalated and plated 
                Lithium across a wide range of charging/discharging rates. It can therefore serve as a useful tool for prediction and 
                control of degradation mechanism in battery cells.
