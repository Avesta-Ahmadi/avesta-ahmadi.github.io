                Relations in Models Describing Lithium Plating in Battery Cells </h2> 
            <p class="lead-paragraph"> 
                In this study we construct a data-driven model describing Lithium plating in a battery cell, 
                            which is a key process contributing to degradation of such cells. Starting from the fundamental 
                            Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, we use asymptotic reduction and spatial averaging techniques 
                            to derive a simplified representation to track the temporal evolution of two key concentrations 
                            in the system, namely, the total intercalated Lithium on the negative electrode particles and 
                            total plated Lithium. This model depends on an a priori unknown constitutive relations of the 
                            cell as a function of thestate variables. An optimal form of this constitutive relation is then 
                            deduced from experimental measurements of the time dependent concentrations of different Lithium 
                            phases acquired through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. This is done by solving an 
                            inverse problem in which this constitutive relation is found subject to minimum assumptions as a 
                            minimizer of a suitable constrained optimization problem where the discrepancy between the model 
                            predictions and experimental data is minimized. This optimization problem is solved using a 
                            state-of-the-art adjoint-based technique. In contrast to some of the earlier approaches to 
                            modelling Lithium plating, the proposed model is able to predict non-trivial evolution of the 
                            concentrations in the relaxation regime when no current isapplied to the cell. When equipped with 
                            an optimal constitutive relation, the model provides accurate predictions of the time evolution 
                            of both intercalated and plated Lithium across a wide range of charging/discharging rates. It 
                            can therefore serve as a useful tool for prediction and control of degradation mechanism in battery cells.
